**End to end encryption for facebook messenger.**

Built on electron and axolotlâ€“â€“a ratcheting forward secrecy [protocol](https://github.com/trevp/double_ratchet/wiki) by Open Whisper Systems.

While facebook supports optional end-to-end encryption for the messenger app, they still hold your private keys. Take back your private keys.
